# W7D2 Notes

## REACT

- in React, index.js runs first and looks for public/index.html
- components should be capitalized as well as the file name 
- If you want to embed a variabe inside divs, use curly brackets. Just like alligator tag
- Browser can only read js, html, jsx
- Babel: translates jsx into html 
- ALWAYS have to declare variable before return
- REACT will change if there's a change in props or states
- in REACT, if something changes `(ie. event.target.value)` the entire component re-renders
