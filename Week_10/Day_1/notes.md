# W10D1 Notes

## MVC (Model View Controller)
- Model: responsible for interacting with the data
- View: Templating engine/creates webpage for the client
- Controller: communicates between model and view

## Rails
`rails generate scaffold <filename>`: This one command will create ALOT of useful files that can be used in a page.
